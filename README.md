Tensorflow implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

# Tensorflow DCGAN

I created this repository just to experiment with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) using TensorFlow/Keras. DCGANs are a type of generative model that use convolutional neural networks to generate new data that resembles a given dataset.

## About DCGAN
DCGANs are a powerful class of models that can learn to generate realistic images by training a *generator* network to produce images and a *discriminator* network to distinguish between real and generated images. The two networks are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner until the generator produces images that are indistinguishable from real data by the discriminator.

## Training Details
Due to the limitations of my low-end GPU (GT1030), I trained this DCGAN for approximately 50 epochs. While training for more epochs might yield better results, it was not feasible for me given the hardware constraints.

## Output
Below is an example output gif generated by the trained DCGAN:

## Dependencies
To run this code, you'll need the following dependencies:
- TensorFlow (version 2.10.1)
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the `train.py` script to start training the DCGAN.\
    You can start training from scratch or resume training from a previously saved checkpoints `h5s` by uncommenting this lines in the `train.py` script
    ```python
    discriminator = keras.models.load_model("h5s\\discriminator_51.h5")
    generator = keras.models.load_model("h5s\\generator_51.h5")
    ```
4. After training, you can use the trained model to generate new images using the `generate.py` script and passing the path to the saved generator model as an argument.\
    ```bash
    python generate.py h5s/generator_51.h5
    ```

Feel free to experiment with the hyperparameters, network architectures, and datasets to explore the capabilities of DCGANs further.
